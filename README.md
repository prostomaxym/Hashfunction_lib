# Hashfunction_lib

This is one of my first pet projects using C++. 
It is a simple library with several hash functions realised: SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA512, MD5, RIPEMD 160.
It works with std::strings inputs and returnes std::string hex digest. Made on purpose to get better understanding of bitwise operations and hash functions
